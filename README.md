# AngryBird-GD

A simple game like Angry Birds but with some different game mechanics.
This project was part of the class "Game Programming" at Hochschule Mittweida. The code is my own and has already been reviewed by the corresponding Professor. 

It's build with Unity and the code is documentated and readable. Feel free to review the code by yourself or clone this project to test it.
